# Japanese urban statistics explorer

A web data visualizer to examine urban behavior based on data from [stat.go.jp](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/), and derivatives.

You've reached the public Github repository for jpstat.
The tool is currently hosted by Github [here](https://freedaemons.github.io/jpstat/) with an alias available at [jpstat.sg](https://jpstat.sg), but not yet.

If you are interested in the methodology, you can view a PDF presentation located in the 'presentation' directory, but it'll only be created after some extensions work to the raw data has been done, likely involving [POMDPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process) or [agent-based modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model).
